In traditional hydrologic engineering design, runoff volumes are estimated from historical meteorological records that are used to derive estimates of storm magnitude, traditionally presented through intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves. The IDF curves are then used to calculate runoff from a design storm of a specified rainfall frequency and duration using event-based hydrologic rainfall-runoff models. This design paradigm makes several significant assumptions, including climate stationarity, no consideration of snowmelt-driven runoff, and limited or no influence from antecedent conditions. It also implicitly assumes that the reoccurrence interval of a rainfall event produces a runoff event of the same interval. Given the potential impacts of climate change, these limiting assumptions can substantially increase infrastructure development risks because structures designed to meet traditional criteria (e.g., 10-year, 1-hour storm or 100-year, 6-hour storm) could be over- or under-designed leading to issues of safety and unnecessary expense. This research will critically evaluate these assumptions individually and in combination to (1) improve our understanding of the non-uniform spatial and temporal distribution of potential climate-induced changes in the intensity and variability of heavy precipitation and runoff events; (2) develop next-generation IDF curves that account for snowmelt and climate non-stationarity; (3) evaluate the ability of current event-based rainfall-runoff models to exploit next-generation IDF curves; and (4) evaluate the ability of next-generation IDF curves coupled with event-based models to accurately inform hydrologic design, including the frequency of specific runoff events.

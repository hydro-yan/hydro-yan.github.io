Two sets of QA/QC daily SNOTEL data (compressed zip file) up through 09/30/2017 for 825 active stations located in western United States and Alaska are available to download.

- [two_stage_filtered_data](https://dhsvm.pnnl.gov/downloads/data/two_stage_filtered_data.zip): Removed erroneous values and outliers in precipitation, temperature, and SWE using a two-stage filter as described in Yan et al. (2018).
- [three_stage_filtered_data](https://dhsvm.pnnl.gov/downloads/data/three_stage_filtered_data.zip): Removed erroneous values and outliers in precipitation, temperature, and SWE, as well as “inconsistent water year” data using a three-stage filter (see Yan et al., 2018 for details).
